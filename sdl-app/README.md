# SDL Application

This is currently being used to test features using the SDL library.

There are currently two executables: one that displays a blank SDL window for two seconds, and one that displays
Mcleod's face for 20 seconds. 

The Makefile has been configured to include SDL (if it is installed in the right directory) and any other libraries
you need, just change the source files and executable name as desired.

Note: This code is based off a tutorial by Lazy Foo' Productions

# SDL Application

This is currently being used to test features using the SDL library.

Sam: I built a make file that includes the source file, the path to SDL (on my computer), and other important arguments, but even if I run it, I get errors in my source code saying that it can't find SDL.
I have verified multiple times that the path is correct. When I try to run the make command without the make file Irun into an error but not sure how to fix it just yet. Please let me know if you find out how to resolve this issue.
